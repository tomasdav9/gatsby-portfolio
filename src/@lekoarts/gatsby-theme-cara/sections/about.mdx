## About

> A young passionate developer from Czech Republic seeking for a new experience.

Since 2020, I've been solving digital problems, that every bussines hates. I've been coding from simple bussines websites to
complex e-commerce websites and communcating with customers about their needs as well. I am opened to a new experience and I like working in a team.
I use Laravel, NodeJS (Typescript), MySQL and Redis for backend stuff and NuxtJS (Vue), Bootstrap for frontend stuff.
I also have some experience at using React Native, NextJS and C#.
